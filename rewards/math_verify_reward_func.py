# Lazy-initialized process pool for reward computation.
# Subprocesses have their own main thread, so signal.SIGALRM (used by
# math_verify's @timeout decorator) works correctly — unlike in the
# async/overlap engine where the Ray actor may not be on the main thread.
#
# IMPORTANT: We use "spawn" (not the default "fork") because this pool
# is created inside a Ray actor that already has an active CUDA context,
# NCCL communicators, and torch.distributed state.  Plain fork() would
# duplicate that state into the child, causing silent corruption or hangs.
# "spawn" starts a fresh Python interpreter via exec — no inherited state.
# Slightly slower first-time startup (children re-import modules), but the
# pool is created once and workers are reused across all subsequent calls.
# _run_verification is pure-CPU (sympy/math_verify) and needs no GPU.

        Creates a language-aware extractive match metric that extracts answers from the model's output.
        Known issues:
        - If the task is to simplify an expression, the metric might overestimate the accuracy. This is because if the model doesn't output any anchor for the extraction (e.g final answer is..),
            it's possible that the the extracted prediction will be the expression to simplify. Because we do simplifications ourselves, it can thus happen that sympy will correctly simplify the expression,
            thus it will match gold, despite model not doing anything. PRs to fix this are welcome.

        Args:
            gold_extraction_target: Sequence[ExtractionTarget]
                Extraction targets to use for gold answers. Defaults to extracting simple math expressions.
            pred_extraction_target: Sequence[ExtractionTarget]
                Extraction targets to use for predictions. Defaults to extracting simple math expressions.
            aggregation_function: Callable[[list[float]], float]
                Function to aggregate scores when multiple golds/predictions are present. Defaults to max.
            precision: int
                Number of decimal places to use when comparing numerical values. Defaults to 6.

        Returns:
            A sample level metric that extracts and compares mathematical expressions.
