# FeynRL Architecture Overview

FeynRL is designed with a **separation of concerns** between algorithmic logic and system-level orchestration. This modularity allows researchers and engineers to focus on developing new methods while leveraging a scalable, high-performance training stack.

## System Components

### 🛰️ Orchestration (Ray)
Ray serves as the central orchestrator, managing the lifecycle of distributed workers across a cluster. It schedules:
- **Training Workers**: Handle distributed training using DeepSpeed.
- **Rollout Workers**: Generate trajectories using vLLM rollout engines.

### 🖥️ Training Engine (DeepSpeed)
The training engine utilizes **DeepSpeed** for distributed training, supporting:
- **ZeRO Stage 1/2/3**: Efficient parameter, gradient, and optimizer state partitioning.
- **CPU Offloading**: Optional offloading of optimizer states and parameters to CPU memory to handle larger models.
- **LoRA Support**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning via PEFT integration.

### 🎲 Rollout Engine (vLLM)
Trajectory generation is powered by **vLLM**, which provides:
- **High Throughput Generation**: Optimized kernels and PagedAttention for fast inference.
- **Tensor Parallelism**: Capability to shard large models across multiple GPUs for rollout.
- **Dynamic Loading**: Support for directly updating policy weights during training.

### Weight Synchronization
FeynRL supports two methods for syncing weights from the training engine to the rollout workers:
1. **Direct Sync**: Weights are gathered from training engines and pushed to rollout workers via Ray's shared-memory object store, avoiding disk I/O entirely.
2. **Disk Sync**: Weights are saved as a checkpoint to disk, and rollout workers reload from the saved path. This also serves as an automatic fallback if direct sync fails.

### 🔁 Training↔Rollout Scheduling
FeynRL supports two execution modes that control how rollout generation and training are scheduled:

1. **Synchronous**: Each epoch generates rollouts, trains on them, syncs weights, and repeats. Simple, fully "on-policy", and easy to debug. Training and rollout workers are scheduled sequentially on separate GPUs.
2. **Overlap (async prefetch)**: When enabled, the next epoch's rollouts are scheduled *during* the current training step, running concurrently on separate GPUs. A configurable maximum lag controls how many policy versions the rollout engine can fall behind before a weight sync is forced. This improves GPU utilization by reducing idle time, at the cost of slightly staler rollout data.

## Modularity & Extensibility

- **Algorithm Agnostic**: The system is designed to support various algorithms by providing a common interface for data handling and model updates.
- **Pluggable Rewards**: Custom reward functions can be easily integrated in the configuration.
- **Flexible Data Processing**: The data pipeline supports mixed-dataset sampling with configurable ratios, allowing for complex training recipes.
