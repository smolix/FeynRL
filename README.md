**FeynRL** (pronounced “FineRL”) is a lightweight, modular framework for **post-training and fine-tuning** large models, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), preference learning (e.g., DPO), and reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO variants). It’s built for researchers and engineers who want a robust, **scalable distributed training stack** without sacrificing readability, hackability, or reproducibility.

### 🔁 Why use FeynRL?

FeynRL is a good fit if you want to iterate quickly without losing clarity or control.

- 🧩 **Easy to extend**
Most changes stay local, so you can add new ideas without reshaping the stack.
- 🔧 **One workflow across post training**
SFT, DPO, and RL share the same setup, making comparisons simpler.
- 🚀 **Works at any run size**
Use the same pipeline for a single GPU debug run or a multi node job.

### 🎯 Why We Built This

There are several great open source frameworks for training and post training large models. Many are powerful, but as they scale in scope, they can become harder to modify and come with steep learning curves, often requiring you to understand tightly coupled components before you can make changes with confidence. As a result, adapting them to a new research idea or a new setup can be slow, error prone, and frustrating. That complexity can also hurt reproducibility: when a framework has many moving parts and evolves quickly, experiments become harder to track, debug, and reliably reproduce.

FeynRL is designed to reduce that friction: a **lightweight, modular, scalable** framework that keeps algorithm logic clear and keeps systems concerns explicit. The core design principle is **separation of concerns**: algorithm code stays algorithmic, and systems code stays systems, so components remain easier to understand, test, and extend. In distributed training, some systems details inevitably surface, but FeynRL aims to keep those interfaces as explicit and clean as possible so components remain easy to understand, test, and debug.

This is the first public release, so expect rough edges. Our goal is to keep FeynRL **simple, efficient, and predictable**. We're open-sourcing it to provide a framework that's easy to reason about, and to build it alongside the community that will stress-test it, extend it, and improve it.


## 🏗️ Overview

FeynRL is built around three core principles:

- ⚡ **Efficiency**: Designed for training models with billions of parameters, using DeepSpeed for distributed training, vLLM for fast inference, and Ray for orchestration at scale.
- 🧩 **Modularity**: Clear separation between training engines, rollout generation, and data handling, so it’s easy to swap components and experiment safely.
- 🧠 **Algorithm-first**: Designed to accelerate research with a simple, hackable codebase that keeps the focus on the algorithms.

For a more detailed breakdown, see the **[Architecture Overview](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

### ✅ What’s Included

- 🧪 **Training paradigms**: RL (PPO, SGRPO, CISPO), preference-based learning (DPO), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
- 🖥️ **Distributed training**: Multi-GPU and multi-node via DeepSpeed (ZeRO Stage 1/2/3)
- 🎲 **Rollouts / inference**: vLLM-powered rollout engines with tensor parallelism
- 🛰️ **Orchestration**: Ray for scheduling training and rollout workers across nodes
- 🔁 **Training↔rollout scheduling**: Sync and Async modes to further improve throughput
- 🔄 **Weight sync**: Fast in-memory transfer with disk fallback
- 🧷 **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning**: LoRA via PEFT
- 📈 **Experiment tracking**: MLflow and Weights & Biases support
- 🏅 **Evaluation**: Standalone eval pipeline with vLLM engines

FeynRL runs at scale with multi-GPU and multi-node training, and uses vLLM-powered rollout engines for fast inference and evaluation. Ray orchestrates training and rollout workers across nodes, with periodic weight synchronization from training to rollout workers via in-memory transfer when supported (and a disk-based fallback). To improve overall throughput, FeynRL can run in synchronous mode (generate rollouts, then train) or asynchronous mode (overlap generation and training), trading off utilization against how off-policy the collected samples may be. It also supports LoRA fine-tuning, pluggable experiment tracking, configurable mixed-dataset sampling, and a standalone evaluation pipeline.
